# Description

This is a PWA app developed to digitise the collection of drill hole data in the open pit mining operations. Measuring blast pattern hole depths after drilling to determine compliance with design depths is an important step in best practice quality assurance / quality control for drill and blast processes.

Becuase internet connection coverage cannot be 100% reliable in surface mining operations, storing data on devices to ensure no data losses is imperative. As such, this app uses IndexedDB to reliably store blast pattern polygons and hole data on the device, and will allow access to this data when working offline.

The user can Sync the device data with the cloud database when internet network coverage allows.
